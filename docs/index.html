    LLVM M.D. (Mis-optimization Detector) is a compiler research project at
    <a href="http://seas.harvard.edu">Harvard University</a>.

    <p/> Our goal is to detect when a compiler optimization changes the meaning
    of the input program. This almost always indicates a bug in the optimizer.

    <p/> For our project we are using the <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM
      optimization framework</a>.

    <p/> Our tools work by analysing two LLVM programs and trying to determine
    if they have the same meaning. Our tools do not require any integration
    with the optimizer to work, and can also be used on hand-optimized code.
    This technique is called "Translation Validation", and our work is focused
    around scaling this technique to a real-world compiler such as LLVM.

    <p/> We hope that our tools will be useful for compiler developers, and for
    industries where safety-critical software is important and optimization is
    needed.
